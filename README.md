# Drone-Object-Detection
In this project, I made a object detection on a drone. First I have created a object detection and then embed it to the drone. And then I not going to install a 100 packages with 50 parameter configurations. I have to model running it 10 to 15 mins.
A drone is able to detect hundreds of object categories in near real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks running on a remote cloud. However, the first of these problems is eroding due to new breakthrough techniques in computer vision that work well on a wide variety of objects.
